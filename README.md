## f

A simple program to pay respects at maximum throughput

## Features

- Easy to remember syntax
- Parallelized outputting of f for increased f throughput

## Roadmap

- Dynamically detect the number of threads available to maximize f throughput
- Explore gcc compiliation for optimized builds (I don't really know how gcc fares against nasm)
- Rewrite in pure binary so that no compiler is needed for even further optimization and increase in f throughput

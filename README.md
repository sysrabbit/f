## f

If it wasn't obvious, this program was a joke I created for internet points when someone decided to do the above task in python, then someone one upped them in c, I felt my self capable of one upping them in assembly.

## Roadmap

- Explore gcc compiliation for optimized builds (I don't really know how gcc fares against nasm)
- Parallelize outputting of f for increased f throughput for maximum paying of respects
- Rewrite in pure binary so that no compiler is needed for even further optimization and increase in f throughput
